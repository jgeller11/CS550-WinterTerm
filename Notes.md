# Notes on how to use GitHub

Github operates through a handful of operations, and is mostly a system of file organization and version control.

Repositories are used to organize individual groups of files, and then branches can be used to track versions of just one of those files. When a file is in a working state, it can be comitted to the master branch, where only working versions of code should be kept.

By creating a pull request, you can request an admins permission to commit a file to the master branch, and an admin may review the file to make sure it's in working order before fulfilling the request.

In the desktop app, you can manage files locally on your computer, and in doing so you can edit code in a text editor of your choice, rather than the lacking editor on the GitHub site.

Once you have reached a verson of the code you want to save, save the file locally to the repository, then click "fetch origin," commit it to the branch, and push it to the online repository.
